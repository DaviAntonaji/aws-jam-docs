Task and Clues
Background
Now that you have found overly permissive access that could potentially allow unauthorized access to the Jam challenge bucket, you need to resolve this overly permissive access policies that may be leaving the bucket open to unauthorized access.

Your Task
Your task is to make sure that there are no active findings in IAM Access Analyzer which lists JAM challenge S3 buckets as the resource.

Getting Started
Visit the Jam challenge bucket in the S3 console and try to resolve the overly permissive access as mentioned in IAM Access Analyzer findings.

Inventory
AWS IAM Access Analyzer has been already created for you. You can find the Jam challenge S3 bucket in the Output Properties section.

Services you should use
AWS IAM, IAM Access Analyzer, Amazon S3

Task Validation
In order to confirm a change you made to resolve the finding, you may have to rescan the resource reported in the finding by using the Rescan link in the Findings details page of IAM Access Analyzer.

The task will auto complete once you fix the overly permissive access in the Challenge bucket and the Rescan shows a success status. You can also validate your progress by selecting the Check my progress button.
